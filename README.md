# JS1k 2019 demo

These are my sources and wips while building my js1k. For whoever cares :)

Working demo on github as it was before minification: https://pvdz.github.io/js1kdemo2019/js1k.full.html

The final js1k can be found at https://js1k.com/2019-x/demo/4110

A blog post on this entry can be found at https://pvdz.ee/weblog/426

You can use the [gui](https://pvdz.github.io/js1kdemo2019/js1k.full.html) to compile your warrior so it works in the demo since this version has a much better parser.

Enjoy!
