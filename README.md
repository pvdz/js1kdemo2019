# JS1k 2019 demo

These are my sources and wips while building my js1k. For whoever cares :)

A working pre-minification demo can be found on github pages.

The final js1k can be found at https://js1k.com/2019-x/demo/4110

A blog post on this entry can be found at https://pvdz.ee/weblog/426

You can use the gui to compile your warrior so it works in the demo since this version has a much better parser.

Enjoy!
